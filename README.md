## All Possible Subsequences of a String
Given a string s. Find all of its subsequences.<br>[NOTE: Subsequnces need not to be contiguous, but must maintain the order of the characters]

## Binary Search
Given an array of integers and a target, return TRUE if target is present in the array otherwise return FALSE.

## Bubble Sort
Sort the given array using bubble sort technique.

## Fibonacci Number
Given an integer N, return the Nth term of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci Sequence</a>. 

## Find Number of Occurences
Find number of occurences of a given target element in an array.

## Insertion Sort
Sort the given array using insertion sort technique.

## Inversion Pair Count

## Longest Common Substring
Given 2 strings as input s1, s2. Find the longest common substring between them.

## Longest Common Subsequence
Given 2 strings as input s1, s2. Find the longest common subsequence between them.

## Merge Sort
Sort the given array using merge sort technique.<br>
<small>NOTE: Merge Sort is one of the most efficient sorting technique, even then why we don't use it everywhere?<br> The simple ans to this is Merge Sort takes a lot of memory to divide the given array into smaller parts. But think if the array size is 1M, 10M, 100M, 1B & so on, so we cannot afford that huge memory. That's where Quick Sort comes into picture.<small>

## Phone Keypad
<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/">Problem Description</a>

## Power Set
Find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set">power set</a> of the given array. 

## Quick Sort
Sort the given array using Quick Sort technique.<br>
**NOTE:** Quick sort is very memory efficient, it doesn't use any extra memory the store array elements. Its time complexity is almost same as merge sort i.e. O(NlogN) on an avg, in worst case it is O(N^2).

## Selection Sort
Sort the given array using Selection Sort technique.
